# Dr. No Health

** A GoldenEye: Source game mode which focuses on reducing armor camping. **

## Features

* Players may not pick up armor until reaching a specified number of kills since their last pickup, a number set by the server owner.

## Installation and Usage

* Place DrNoHealth.py into your gesource/python/ges/GamePlay folder.
* Start the game or server, and run the following command in your console:

'''
ge_gameplay drnohealth

## Support
